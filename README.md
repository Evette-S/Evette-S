👋 Hi, I’m @Evette-S I am a zealous new developer excited to finish stepping into the tech industry. I have always been interested in tech but never had a sense of direction on how to get involved.

🎨 I’m interested in the design aspect of tech. I like to make things visually appealing and have often been told I have a good eye for design in the real world as well for some of my projects.

📚I’m currently learning about front-end development and building my skills on the basics so that I can confidently choose the right career path for myself. I have added some repositories here on different projects I have worked on thus far.
  
🤝I’m looking to collaborate: on open-source projects that can help me hone the skills that I have learned thus far in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also want to contribute to the developer community and get feedback that will help me improve my skills.

📫 How to reach me: I am always looking to connect and meet fellow developers. As well as share and give feedback on room for improvement. feel free to reach out to me here on GitHub.
